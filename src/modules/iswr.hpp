* \brief
*
* This aggregates the _no_slope direct and diffuse flat plane estimates provided by other modules and calculates a unified
 * variant that includes (if required) slope effects and applies shadow masks from shadowing modules.
*
* Depends:
* - Shortwave direct on a flat plane "iswr_direct_no_slope" [W/m^2]
* - Shortwave diffuse on a flat plane "iswr_diffuse_no_slope" [W/m^2]

* Provides:
* - Shortwave all beam "iswr" [W/m^2]
* - Shortwave direct "iswr_direct" [W/m^2]
* - Shortwave diffuse "iswr_diffuse" [W/m^2]
