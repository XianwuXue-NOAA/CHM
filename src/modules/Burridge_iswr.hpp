 * \brief Computes incoming shortwave radiation using a cloud fraction.
 *
 * Computes incoming direct and diff shortwave radiation using a cloud fraction based on RH at 700mb.
 *
 * Depends:
 * - cloud_frac (-)
 *
 * Provides:
 * - Shortwave all beam "iswr" [W/m^2]
 * - Shortwave direct "iswr_direct" [W/m^2]
 * - Shortwave diffuse "iswr_diffuse" [W/m^2]
 * - Atmospheric transmittance, [0,1] "atm_trans" [-]
