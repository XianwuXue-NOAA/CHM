* \brief Calculates precipitation
*
* Spatially distributes liquid water precipitation using the Thornton, et al. 1997 method.
* Unlike Thornton_p, this calculates scaling rates based on observed data on a per-timestep basis
*
*
* Depends:
* - Precip from met file "p" [mm]
*
* Provides:
* - Precip "p" [mm]
