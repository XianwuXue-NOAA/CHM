*
* Spatially interpolates observed shortwave measurements and splits it into direct and diffuse beams. This split
 * is via Iqbal
*
* Depends:
* -  Shortwave radiation met file "Qsi" [W/m^2]
*
* Provides:
* - Shortwave all beam "iswr" [W/m^2]
* - Shortwave direct "iswr_direct" [W/m^2]
* - Shortwave diffuse "iswr_diffuse" [W/m^2]
* - Atmospheric transmittance, [0,1] "atm_trans" [-]
